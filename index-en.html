                <p>
                    Greetings, we as in KrasDesign are a company that delivers what is asked. 20 years ago I (Jan) and Freek founded this beautiful company, we are very proud of what it has become. KrasDesign started as a small company that designed logos for private companies and freelancers. We eventually decided to get more out of this company, only logos were not enough for us, after brainstorming for a while I came to Freek with the idea of creating custom websites and certain corporate identities and eventually selling them to the buyer. This idea has made us who we are today, with the wide range of services we offer, we make every idea possible. That is ultimately what it is all about for KrasDesign. A Kras media concept for any business.

                        The time has finally come! We are moving! The building in which we have worked for the past 20 years is becoming a thing of the past. It was high time for an expansion, due to our wide range and the ever-growing number of employees and applications, this also requires more space, more information about the move can be found under the heading: Relocation!
